# Rust in Motion

This repo contains the code samples we discuss in the [Rust in Motion video course](https://www.manning.com/livevideo/rust-in-motion?a_aid=cnichols&a_bid=6a993c2e).

Unless otherwise noted, the code was written with Rust 1.24.1. If the code sample compiles, it will
continue to compile with newer versions of the Rust compiler, thanks to Rust's stability
guarantees. If the code sample does not compile (because we are illustrating an error message), the
error message might be different in newer versions. In some cases, the code will compile with newer
versions!

The files are organized into directories by unit and module, and then named starting with the time
in the video where we begin discussing that example. Each module contains a README.md describing
the examples and noting if they purposefully don't compile.

In the videos, we disabled unused code warnings to avoid cluttering up the screen. You'll likely
see warnings about unused variables, enum variants, and fields when you run these examples with
`cargo run`.
